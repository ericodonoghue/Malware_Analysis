## Task 1: Build a virus

This project was really difficult but very rewarding and I learned a ton. I have a super in depth understanding of the PE structure and how virus technqiues are implemented.

The functionaility is as follows: compile program1.cpp, program2.cpp, and program3.cpp resulting in program1.exe, program2.exe, and program2.exe. Then run `program3.exe program1.exe program2.exe`.
This will create retrofitting.exe in the same directory program3.exe is run from. Running retrofitting.exe will print "Hello program2" then "Hello program1" then hides the console and 
begins keylogging. If you want to test the functionaility without the keylogger simply comment out line 422 in program1.cpp and redo the above steps. 

I implemented the keylogger extra credit into my program1. Instead of simply printing the keys to the console, it will hide the console and log keys saving them to C:\Users\Public\Public\keylogs.txt.
