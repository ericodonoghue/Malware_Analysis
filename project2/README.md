## Task 1: PE Tables

The purpose of this task is to gain a better understanding of the tables within PE files and how to access virtual memory so that we can later manipulate those structures with our malcicious code. 

This task wass completed using C++ and C++ functions from stdio.h for opening and reading the exectuable data. We use the windows.h import so we can use values such as WORD and DWORD when building our structs. We read the executable data into structs and then printed each field. 

Example of some of the table structs defined for this project:

Completeing this gave me a better understanding of how PE data is saved into different places in memory and how we go about accesing the different information. 

## Results
full outputs for each PE file can be found respectivly in: stardust.txt, antivirusplatinum.txt, kernel32.txt
