As we can see above the parent process is EngHost.exe. This was very simple, we just opneded process exploerer and found the notepad.exe process.

As we can see above the flag is exception. This consisted of setting a break point on main and stepping until we hit the dvision by 0. This gave us the answer.

As we can see above the flag is highlighted. To find this I attached WinDBG to the kernel and used the x command to search for symbols and found all symbols associated with nt!WarbirdCrypto giving us the answer. 

## Task 4:

As we can see the flag is does. To find this I used the command s -a fffff807`64e0000 L?01047000 "Magic". We can see that we are seraching for ascii values with the -a falg, we start at where nt is loaded ie that image base. and the length we search for is the entire size of the image. 

## Task 5:
